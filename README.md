 ### [Final Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XY-IkmFSVpGf2ivB0i6Xu9RDrAI4c4sr/view?usp=sharing)

<h2>Description</h2>
The project aims to conduct a comprehensive data analysis of Suraj Milk, an imaginary company, focusing on sales and supply performance in the dairy sector from 2019 to 2022 in India. This analysis is crucial due to the significant impact of COVID-19 and the subsequent quarantine periods, which adversely affected dairy product sales. The data analytics process includes defining the core problems, data cleaning and preparation, and conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We will create dashboards to visualize key metrics, gain insights from the data, and provide actionable recommendations for Suraj Milk to adapt its business strategy. By leveraging four years of sales and supply data, the project will enable Suraj Milk to identify strategic business strengths and formulate plans to enhance resilience and growth in the post-pandemic landscape.
